<b>Description : </b>

Dunkirk is an upcoming English-language war film written, co-produced and directed by Christopher Nolan. 
The film stars Fionn Whitehead, Tom Glynn-Carney, Jack Lowden, Harry Styles, Aneurin Barnard, James D'Arcy, Barry Keoghan, Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy, Mark Rylance, and Tom Hardy.
Nolan wrote the script, told from three perspectives–the land, sea and air–to contain little dialogue and to create suspense solely through details. Filming began in May 2016 in Dunkirk, France, and ended in Los Angeles, United States, where it would also commence post-production. Set during World War II, it concerns the Dunkirk evacuation.
