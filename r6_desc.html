<b>Description : </b>
Badrinath "Badri" Bansal (Varun Dhawan) is the younger son of a wealthy family in Jhansi. In a flashback, we see that Badri's older brother, Alok (Yash Sinha) was in love with a girl and was going to leave the family for her (because their father disapproved), but decided against it after their father's first heart attack. Now Alok is married to Urmila (Swetha Basu Prasad) through an arranged marriage and she is not allowed to work despite being very intelligent and professionally trained, more than Alok himself. Alok is also depressed at having to leave his love and be forced into a marriage, so spends a lot of time drinking. Badri fears the same fate for himself so when he sees Vaidehi Trivedi (Alia Bhatt) at a wedding, he becomes obsessed with her and makes it his mission to marry her with his father's approval.
