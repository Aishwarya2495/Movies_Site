A successful and single physician officially provides obstetrics and gynaecology service but also gives couples advice on happiness. The twist is that she has not enjoyed success in her own romantic life. She travels between her job in the United States and her immediate family's location in Mexico. She asks her co-worker to pose as her boyfriend at a family wedding back in Mexico. When her ex beau shows up, comedy mayhem takes place.
