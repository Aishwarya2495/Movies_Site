<b>Description : </b>
A man named Timothy "Tim" Templeton (Tobey Maguire) tells a story about his 7-year-old self (Miles Bakshi) who lives with his parents, Ted (Jimmy Kimmel) and Janice (Lisa Kudrow). One day, Tim is surprised when an infant wearing a business suit shows up in a taxi at his house, and Ted and Janice call him Tim's little brother. Tim is envious of the attention the baby receives, not to mention suspicious when the infant acts odd around him.
