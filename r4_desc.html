<b>Description : </b>
The film opens with Shiv (Sushant Singh Rajput) moving from India to Budapest for a job as a banker, along with his friend Radha (Varun Sharma). Shiv is shown to have been a fun-loving womanizer back home and continues this behavior in Budapest. The audience is then introduced to Saira (Kriti Sanon), who is haunted by mysterious nightmares of drowning to death. She lives by herself in Budapest, working as a chocolatier. Shiv happens upon Saira's shop while on a date with a woman, but finds himself deeply attracted to Saira. Though she initially rejects his advances, Saira eventually succumbs and sleeps with Shiv, revealing the next day that she actually has a boyfriend and does not want to betray him.
